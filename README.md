# Udacity Storefront Backend Project
The company stakeholders want to create an online storefront to showcase their great product ideas. Users need to be able to browse an index of all products, see the specifics of a single product, and add products to an order that they can view in a cart page. I have been tasked with building the API that will support this application, and my coworker who is building the frontend.

## Project setup

First, clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wmuza/MyStore.git
```

Then switch into the repo folder
```bash
cd MyStore
```

# Angular Version
